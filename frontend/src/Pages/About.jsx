            Our Story
          </h2>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            At Your Kokulam Multi Shop, our journey began with a simple vision:
            to create a welcoming space where families and individuals alike
            could find fresh, locally sourced produce, pantry staples, and
            specialty items. What started as a small venture has blossomed into
            a cornerstone of the community, driven by our passion for wholesome
            living and a commitment to supporting local farmers and producers.
